## 🔄 Technical Challenges

### 1. OAuth Implementation Complexity

**Description:** Instagram's OAuth flow requires careful state management and CSRF protection.
**Impact:** 🟠 Medium - Delayed authentication implementation by 2 days
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Resolution:**
Implemented secure state parameter generation and validation. Added comprehensive error handling for OAuth failures.

```javascript
// Example of secure state generation and storage
generateRandomState() {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15) +
           Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15);
}

// Store state before redirect
const state = this.generateRandomState();
localStorage.setItem('instagram_auth_state', state);
```

### 2. API Limitations for Stories Access

**Description:** Instagram Basic Display API doesn't provide direct access to user stories.
**Impact:** 🔴 High - May require business account and Graph API
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Resolution:**
Currently using mock data for stories. Investigating options:
1. Upgrade to Instagram Graph API (requires business account)
2. Implement UI with disclaimer about stories limitations
3. Use alternative approach with user's permission

### 3. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

**Description:** API requests from browser being blocked by CORS policy.
**Impact:** 🟠 Medium - Prevents direct API calls from frontend
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Resolution:**
Implemented a Node.js backend with Express to serve as a proxy for Instagram API requests. This resolves CORS issues and improves security by keeping API credentials server-side.

```javascript
// CORS configuration in server.js
app.use(cors({
  origin: config.nodeEnv === 'production'
    ? ['https://yourdomain.com']
    : ['http://localhost:8080', 'http://127.0.0.1:5500', 'http://localhost:5500'],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));
```
